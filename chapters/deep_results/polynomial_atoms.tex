\section{Countably many atoms}
In the previous section, we have seen that the degree of $\fs{n^2}$ is an atom (\cref{n2_atom}). We also stated that the degree of the stream $\fs{n}$ is an atom (\cref{n_atom}) as shown in \cite{streams:degrees:2011}. In this section, we state some results from \cite{streams:degrees:polynomials:2016}. This completes the current state of the research concerning atom degrees.

\vspace{1em}

A surprising result is that, although the degrees of $\fs{n}$ and $\fs{n^2}$ are atoms, the degree of $\fs{n^3}$ is not. In fact, the degree of $\fs{n^k}$ is not an atom for each $k\geq 3$.

\begin{theorem}[\cite{streams:degrees:polynomials:2016}]
	For $k\geq 3$, we have that $[\fs{n^k}]$ is not an atom.
\end{theorem}

We will quickly highlight the main result of \cite{streams:degrees:polynomials:2016}. Namely, that we can find countably many atom degrees!

\begin{theorem}[\cite{streams:degrees:polynomials:2016}]
	Let $k\geq 1$. Then there exists a polynomial $P_k$ of degree $k$ such that $[\fs{P_k}]$ is an atom.
\end{theorem}

For the proofs of both statements, we refer to the paper \textit{Degrees of Infinite Words, Polynomials and Atoms} \cite{streams:degrees:polynomials:2016}.
