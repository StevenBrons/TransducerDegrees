\section{Transducer degrees}
We can finally define the main topic of this thesis: \textit{transducer degrees}. We start by defining an order on streams called ``$\geq$''.

\begin{definition}\label{def_geq_equiv}
	For streams $\sigma,\tau\in\streams$ we say that $\sigma \geq \tau$ if and only if there exists a FST $T$ such that $\sigma \geq_T \tau$.
	We say that $\sigma \equiv \tau$ if and only if $\sigma \geq \tau \land \tau \geq \sigma$.
\end{definition}

This definition makes $(\streams, \geq)$ a partially ordered set, poset for short. We show this in \cref{poset_streams}. Furthermore, ``$\equiv$'' is an equivalence relation, as we show in \cref{equivalence_relation}. This makes it possible to speak about the equivalence classes of the quotient $\TD$. We denote the equivalence class of a stream $\sigma\in\streams$ by $[\sigma]\in\TD$.

\begin{definition}{Transducer degree.}\\
	A \textit{transducer degree} is an element of the set of equivalence classes $[\sigma] \in \TD$ of the equivalence relation $\equiv$ defined above. We call this set of equivalence classes \textit{transducer degrees}.
\end{definition}

We can again define a partial order, this time on \textit{transducer degrees}. 

\begin{definition}\label{order_on_td}
	For transducer degrees $[\sigma],[\tau]\in\TD$ we say that $[\sigma] \geq [\tau] \iff \sigma \geq \tau$. Note that we use the same symbol to denote the order on transducer degrees and streams. 
\end{definition}

We must show that this definition is well defined: that it does not depend on the specific representatives $\sigma,\tau$. We must show that, for streams $\sigma,\sigma',\tau,\tau'\in\streams$, if $\sigma \equiv \sigma'$ and $\tau \equiv \tau'$, then $[\sigma] \geq [\tau] \iff [\sigma'] \geq [\tau']$. This follows directly from the definition of $\equiv$ and the fact that $\geq$ (as order on streams) is transitive.
\\
In this thesis, we will mainly speak about facts of streams, but because of the above definition, we can directly translate this to facts about transducer degrees.
